# Delay-Embeddings-and-ML-Asset-Forecasting

# Overview #
An exploration into delay embeddings on time series data for the purpose of short term forecasting stock data

## Data and Preprocessing #
Minute by minute price data for apple stock was used as the foundational time series for this project. Data was aquired through AlphaAdvantage API (they were very kind in giving me academic access for this purpose). Orginal time series plot showed obvious random walk pattern so first order differencing was applied. ![Graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106636917/232355508-6dd6aea3-64fa-4b82-9390-d84780013ba5.JPG)
